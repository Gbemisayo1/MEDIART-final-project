        <h2>Project 1: Parametric Design</h2>
        <p>
          This design makes use of lines and points that are arranged in a spiral motion. This spiral motion then slowly turns into a circular motion.
          The design made use of 4 colours ( purple, pink, blue and green) with the background being
          black to give a galaxy effect. The image starts out small and slowly grows into a bigger image. I
          think of this action like the growth of an atom.

        <h2>Project 2: Pattern and Repitition</h2>
        <p>
          This repetition pattern is inspired by the peacock and phoenix birds. I focused mainly on the feather of a
          peacock and how the eye within it is shaped and also the royal colors of the peacock and the bright, vibrant
          colors of the phoenix.
          For the eye of the peacock, I created five layers. Four outof the five layers use a raindrop shape with decrease insize for each layer. 
          The innermost layer was createdusing a heart shape. These two shapes were drawnusing the bezierVertex(), beginShape() and endShape()functions.

        <h2>Project 3: Poster Coding </h2>
        <p>
         As a graduate of the African Leadership Academy, I am passionate about showcasing how Africa’s rich cultural
         diversity can come together to create something bold and beautiful, though we have our differences, we can
         still be united as one.The poster design is for a united Africa campaign focused on the fashion industry,
         making use of fabric (clothing material). This poster highlights the beauty of combining different fabric
         traditions from across the continent. By celebrating Africa’s diverse cloth cultures, this poster envisions a
         continent united in creativity, resilience, and shared identity through the lens of fashion..

        <h2>Project 4: Simulation (Game Design)</h2>
        <p>
          The game/ simulation is inspired by the cats on campus. I noticed that anytime the cats are trying to get to their bowls to eat, people are always
          picking them up and cuddling them which hinders them from getting to the food.
          The goal of the game is to get to the food on time,collect rats and to avoid the humans at all costs. 
          Characters: A cat, mice , human beings, cat food ina bowl Control keys: the 4 arrow keys, G for grab, Playbutton for play, B for back and N for next

        <h2>Project 5: Image Transformation</h2>
        <p>
          For this task, I decided to divide the window with a width of 900 pixels and height of 650 pixels into two equal
          halves. Each half has a different transformation added to it but the same image. The idea is that if people try to
          combine the two halves of the window they should be able to get the idea of what the original image looks like.

        <h2>Project 6: Data Visualisation</h2>
        <p>
          For this assignment, I explored the birth rates and death rates from 1960 to 2020 in the 16 West African countries. I wanted to see how the birth
          rate compared to the death rate and if the income rate had any effect on any of the values.
          I got the data from the world bank group website.
